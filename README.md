# Advanced-Machine-Learning

The aim of this project is to train a classification model for the solution of the Caltech256-objectDetection problem. With the help of data augmentation tech- niques, generators for intelligent training and custom callbacks the project has as its ultimate aim to train a classification model based on transfer learning, specifically EfficientNetB3, of the application class of Keras.
